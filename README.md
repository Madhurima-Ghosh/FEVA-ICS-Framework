# Framework for Evasion and Validation of Industrial Control Systems (FEVA-ICS)

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook-based **benchmarking framework** for evaluating the **adversarial robustness** of **Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Anomaly Detectors** in **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**.

The framework is implemented entirely in a single notebook: `framework.ipynb`.

## 📌 Overview

- ⚔️ Evaluate ML-based ICS-IDS under various adversarial attacks
- 🧠 Supports IDS models of different architectures (gradient and non-gradient based)
- 🧪 Measures robustness using key metrics like Accuracy, Recall, and Precision
- 🛠️ Designed for reproducibility and ease of extension

## 📁 Files

- `framework.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the full pipeline:
- Data loading
- Trained Model loading
- Model Stealing
- Evasion Attacks
- Evaluation

## ⚙️ Customization: Parameters, Dataset, and Targeted Model

The framework is **fully customizable**:

- 🔧 **Change the dataset**: Use your own or public datasets like SWaT or BATADAL.
The Datasets are publicly available at:
To install each dataset, simply download and extract the archives on disk. The datasets are redistributions of existing and copyrighted datasets, we only offer a convenient repackaging of these datasets.
- 🎯 **Upload your targeted NIDS**: Upload your own executable targeted ML-based NIDS and Anomaly Detector (in pickle, joblib or h5 format).
- 🧪 **Adjust attack or training parameters** to test different robustness scenarios.
